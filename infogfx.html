To address this reality, the U.S. nuclear deterrent capabilities must continue to confront and deter potential adversaries with the prospect of a rapid, effective, and overwhelming response that would outweigh any benefit they may hope to gain through aggression.  For over 25 years, the United States has maintained and modernized the nuclear arsenal with cutting edge science and technology to effectively deter potential adversaries with a stockpile that is at the top of the pack. NNSA’s  life extension programs (LEPs) underway for our aging nuclear stockpile continue to ensure that our deterrent is robust, flexible, resilient, ready, and appropriately tailored to deter 21st century threats and reassure our allies.</p>
